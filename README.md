# GeoSismic3D – Seismic Data to 3D Printable Models

This repository contains the development of a seismic data processing pipeline that converts real oil and gas industry seismic data (SEG-Y format) into 3D printable models.

The project focuses on reading seismic traces, building 3D seismic volumes, extracting geological horizons, and exporting them as STL files suitable for visualization and 3D printing.

GeoSismic3D integrates geophysics concepts with scientific programming and additive manufacturing for academic and educational purposes.
